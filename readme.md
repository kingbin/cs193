# CS193 Coding Together Summer 2012

I didn’t make the 1000 student cut but I stuck this course out until homework 5 by participating in the online discussion(Piazza), watching the videos and keeping up with the assignments.

##Assignment Notes
Each folder is a different assignment.

For homework 5, because of time, I used a caching class someone wrote to finish up the assignment shy of the iPad version.

I plan to finish up homework 6 and start on a couple iPhone ideas I have in the near future.

##Final
This class has given me a good start on iPhone development and an understanding I found hard to find in books. Paul walks you through parts of the development giving a good explanation on how/why things work the way they do in iOS 5. I also got a chance to colaborate with other developers around the world which I found priceless.

My solutions may not be perfect, but I believe they’re a good start to something good.

As always, criticism is encouraged, I’m eager to learn.
